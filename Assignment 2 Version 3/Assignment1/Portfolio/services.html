				<h4>Web Programming</h4>
				<p>I have experience creating websites using Asp.Net, PHP, Html5, CSS3, JavaScript and Foundation.
				   With my knowledge of databases and SQL I am able to create a creative and functional website for most
				   Businesses looking to have a web presence. I am currently learning to implement e-commerce into websites which will allow me
				   to create a more complex and practical website</p>

			<div class="large-6 columns center-title">
				<h4>Advertising [Flash Banner Advertisements]</h4>
				<p> Although my experience in Adobe Flash is minimal, I have found it to be an experience like no other. With just a few simple clicks
				 I am able to create advertisements that are ready for a real world environment. I find myself learning the application quite quickly 
				 and my capacity for knowledge appears to have no end and with the right amount of time I feel I could create an advertisement worth paying
				 for.</p>

				<h4>Game Programming</h4>
				<p>My experience creating games is currently limited to python and Pygame but as my skills increase with Flash I will be able to create 
				games with that as well. In python I am able to create side scrollers and text based games, which can be seen in the Projects section of 
				this site. I am quite interested in game development and I am looking into other development platforms like Blender.</p>
